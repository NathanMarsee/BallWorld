## Skins

Skins can be unlocked and apllied to the players ball. To do this, go inside of the Options submenu in the Main menu, you will see an option that show's which ball the player has equipped. If it is your first time in this menu, it will likely say "Soccer".  
  
You may look through the options listed. If you are in the Main Menu, you will see a preview of the ball, if you are inside of Infinite or Basketball, you will not see a preview, but the ball will be changed as soon as you purchase or equip a new ball. Inside of the tutorial level, you may change what ball you have equipped, but it will not change until entering one of the aforementioned levels.

The list of skin is as follows:
  1. Soccer - 0 Points (Already unlocked/equipped)
  2. Volleyball - 250 Points
  3. Basketball - 500 Points
  5. Tennis - 750 Points
  6. Football - 1,000 Points
  7. Baseball - 1,000 Points
  8. Golf - 2,000 Points
  9. Eyeball - 3,500 Points  

The points are priced mostly arbitrarily. However, note that the football will still control like a sphere despite its appearance.
